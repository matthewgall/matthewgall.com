Hi, I'm Matthew Gall â€“ an anti-abuse, information security, and software engineer with a passion for building tools that make the internet a safer place.

I recently concluded a decade-long journey at Cloudflare Inc (ending December 2024), where I spent my time hunting down bad actors and malicious threats across the web. My work focused on identifying, analyzing, and neutralizing malicious activity while building robust tools and systems to automate and streamline these critical security processes.

## Background

I'm English, originally from the West Midlands, though I moved around quite a bit when I was young due to my father's Royal Air Force service before settling in Wales for my education. I picked up some Welsh along the way and can proudly pronounce Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch (yes, really).

## What I Do

My expertise lies at the intersection of security and engineering. Over the past decade, I've developed a keen eye for spotting malicious patterns, building detection systems, and creating tools that help security teams work more effectively. Whether it's developing automated abuse detection systems, analyzing threat patterns, or building infrastructure to support security operations, I enjoy the challenge of staying one step ahead of bad actors.

## When I'm Not Working

When I step away from the keyboard, you'll likely find me traveling to new places, discovering great food, or taking long walks with my 8-year-old jug, Bessie. She's an excellent debugging companion and has strong opinions about the optimal walking routes around our neighborhood.
